Hello there! My name is Amreeta, and I am currently pursuing my PhD at the University of California, Merced. I have a BSc in Politics and International Relations from the University of Bristol in the UK. My research interests center around exploring the fundamental mechanisms that influence collective political behaviors and decision-making. My specialization lies at the intersection of gender, technology, and electoral politics, with a particular focus on India.

At present, I am serving as the Lab Manager at the [Political Economy of Agricultural and Rural Societies (PEARS) Lab](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/pears/about), a computational social science lab at UC Merced.
