Hello! My name is Amreeta, and I am currently pursuing my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Merced. I have a BSc in Politics and International Relations from the University of Bristol, UK. My passion lies in understanding how collective political behaviors and decision-making are shaped, and I love combining data science with my interest in politics. My work focuses on using machine learning and statistical models to explore the intersection of gender, technology, and elections. Iâ€™m always excited about the ways data can help unravel the stories behind political dynamics!

At present, I am serving as the Lab Manager at the [Political Economy of Agricultural and Rural Societies (PEARS) Lab](https://sites.ucmerced.edu/pears/about), a computational social science lab at UC Merced specializing in natural experiments, machine learning and geospatial methods.
